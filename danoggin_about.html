                <p><strong>Blue Vista Solutions</strong> is a small, independent software studio dedicated to building thoughtful, practical tools that help real people solve real-world problems. We're not here to chase trends or overload you with features you'll never use — our goal is clarity, reliability, and purpose.</p>
                
                <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                <p>Blue Vista was founded by a recently retired software engineer with decades of experience in both industry and innovation. After stepping away from a long and rewarding career, the focus now is on building tools that matter — whether for health, communication, or creativity — without the noise and complexity that often come with commercial tech.</p>
                
                <h2>What We're Working On</h2>
                <p>Our flagship project, <strong>Danoggin</strong>, is a mobile app designed to assist individuals with conditions that impact cognitive clarity. By delivering simple, timed check-in prompts and alerting loved ones when responses are missed or concerning, Danoggin supports both autonomy and safety — especially in moments where clarity matters most.</p>
                
                <p>It's configurable, cross-platform (iOS and Android), and private by design.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Build what helps.</strong> Every line of code has a reason. If it doesn't help the user, it doesn't belong.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stay grounded.</strong> We favor practical solutions over flashy gimmicks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Respect the user.</strong> That means no tracking, no hidden costs, and clear intentions behind every feature.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>We're exploring new tools for small communities, hobbyists, and individuals looking for smarter ways to connect, learn, or stay well. If that sounds like something you care about, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
